Hello there. What switches are these again? Did you say it was red switches? They're quite quiet, it's nice tbh. I'm not sure if they feel "clicky". Do you like that? It does feel like a membrane keyboard. Did you say it's mechanical switches? I think all the Keychron keyboards are mechanical, yeah. I keep having mistypes which is interesting. I think because there's not much key travel required to activate. It's interesting. jjjjjjj La la la. Wow what are you doing, put my keyboard down punk.
